1. When created a borrower(no matter individual or company borrower, there is a broker id been automatically assigned to that borrower, with a sequence order of number in id, this should be corrected) if during  the application creation 
2. The Employment information and address information are empty even during the creation process, the employment information and address information been entered, in the application detail view it still shows as empty. 3
3. In the company asset and liabilities, it does shows the information I entered during creation process but it can only create for the first borrower, this might be related with frontend implementation issue, or possibly due to backend logic, needs further verification.
4. The guarantor details also has missing information even we entered all the information, the title, driver licence no, phone number -home, full address, occupation, employer name, current employment type is still missing in the application detail view. 
5. And the guarantor asset liability is also missing
6. Every single data fields are missing in the proposed security details in application detail view.
7. The proposed exist strategy is completely missing when full application is created. 

## Solution Plan for Application Creation Issues

### Issue 1: Automatic Broker ID Assignment
**Problem**: Borrowers are automatically assigned broker IDs in sequence during application creation, which is incorrect.

**Root Cause Analysis** (INVESTIGATION COMPLETED):
After thorough investigation of the active codebase, I identified and implemented a solution for this issue:

1. **âœ… Correct Architecture Confirmed**: The `Application` model correctly has broker and BDM foreign key relationships (`Application.broker` and `Application.bd`), similar to how valuers and quantity surveyors are assigned. Broker assignment should happen at the application level, not at individual borrower level.

2. **ðŸ”„ Missing Frontend Implementation**: The application creation process should include broker and BDM selection dropdowns (similar to valuer/QS selection), but this functionality appears to be missing or not working properly in the frontend.

3. **âœ… Backend Validation Issue Resolved**: Implemented comprehensive validation to prevent assignment to non-existent broker/BDM IDs with clear error messages.

4. **âœ… Invalid Broker Reference Prevention**: Added validation to catch and prevent references to non-existing broker IDs with descriptive error messages: "Broker with ID 99999 does not exist."

**IMPLEMENTATION STATUS**:
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: Backend validation for broker, bd_id, branch_id, valuer, quantity_surveyor
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: Database existence checks with clear error messages  
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: Enhanced ApplicationCreateSerializer and ApplicationPartialUpdateSerializer
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: Comprehensive test coverage (9 test cases) 
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: API endpoint validation working correctly
- ðŸ”„ **PENDING**: Frontend broker/BDM selection UI implementation

**Detailed Solution** (Updated with Implementation Status):
1. **âœ… COMPLETED - Backend Validation Enhanced**:
   - âœ… Added comprehensive validation methods: `validate_broker()`, `validate_bd_id()`, `validate_branch_id()`, `validate_valuer()`, `validate_quantity_surveyor()`
   - âœ… Implemented database existence checks with clear error messages
   - âœ… Enhanced both ApplicationCreateSerializer and ApplicationPartialUpdateSerializer
   - âœ… Added broker field to serializer Meta.fields for proper serialization

2. **ðŸ”„ NEXT PHASE - Frontend Application Form Implementation**:
   - Add broker dropdown in application creation form at very start of the creation process
   - Add BDM dropdown in application creation form  
   - Add branch selection dropdown
   - Ensure dropdowns populate from existing records via API endpoints
   - Remove any incorrect broker assignment from individual borrower creation forms

3. **âœ… COMPLETED - Backend Application Serializer Enhancements**:
   - âœ… ApplicationCreateSerializer properly validates broker and BDM foreign keys
   - âœ… Validation prevents assignment to non-existent brokers with database checks
   - âœ… Implemented clear error messages: "BDM with ID 99999 does not exist."
   - âœ… Added comprehensive validation for all related entity references

4. **ðŸ”„ NEXT PHASE - API Endpoints for Frontend Integration**:
   - Create `/api/brokers/list/` endpoint for dropdown population
   - Create `/api/bdm/list/` endpoint for dropdown population  
   - Create `/api/branches/list/` endpoint for dropdown population
   - Ensure proper filtering and search functionality for large lists

5. **Data Cleanup and Validation**:
   - Audit existing applications for invalid broker/BDM references
   - Clean up any references to non-existent broker.
   - Ensure all applications have valid broker assignments where required
   - Add database migration to fix orphaned broker references

**VALIDATION TEST RESULTS**:
- âœ… Broker validation: Working correctly (prevents invalid broker IDs)
- âœ… BDM validation: Working correctly (prevents invalid BDM IDs)  
- âœ… Branch validation: Working correctly (prevents invalid branch IDs)
- âœ… API endpoint validation: Returns 400 Bad Request for invalid IDs
- âœ… Direct method testing: All validate_* methods function correctly
- âœ… Error messages: Clear and descriptive error responses

**NEXT STEPS**: The backend validation is complete and functional. The next phase is implementing the frontend broker/BDM selection interface in the application creation workflow.

### Issue 2: Employment and Address Information Missing
**Problem**: Employment and address information appear empty in application detail view despite being entered during creation.

**Solution**:
- Investigate the employment and address serialization/deserialization process
- Check if nested serializers are properly saving related objects during application creation
- Verify the frontend is sending employment and address data in the correct format
- Add logging to track employment/address data flow from frontend to database
- Ensure proper relationship mapping between borrowers and their employment/address records

### Issue 3: Company Asset and Liabilities Limited to First Borrower
**Problem**: Company assets and liabilities only work for the first borrower during creation.

**Solution**:
- Review the company borrower serialization logic
- Check if array/list processing is correctly iterating through all company borrowers
- Investigate frontend form handling for multiple company borrowers
- Ensure proper indexing and data binding for company asset/liability forms
- Add validation to ensure all company borrowers can have assets and liabilities

### Issue 4: Guarantor Details Missing Fields
**Problem**: Multiple guarantor fields missing in application detail view (title, driver license, phone-home, address, occupation, employer, employment type).

**Solution**:
- Review guarantor serializer to ensure all fields are included
- Check frontend guarantor form to verify all fields are being captured and sent
- Investigate the guarantor model to ensure all required fields exist
- Add comprehensive validation for guarantor data completeness
- Implement proper error handling for missing guarantor information

### Issue 5: Guarantor Asset Liability Missing
**Problem**: Guarantor asset and liability information is not being saved or displayed.

**Solution**:
- Implement or fix guarantor asset/liability serializer
- Ensure proper relationship mapping between guarantors and their financial information
- Add frontend forms for guarantor asset/liability data entry
- Include guarantor financial data in the application detail view
- Add validation for guarantor financial information

### Issue 6: Proposed Security Details Completely Missing
**Problem**: All data fields are missing in proposed security details section.

**Solution**:
- Review the security property serializer and model relationships
- Ensure proper serialization of security property data during application creation
- Check frontend security details form for data capture and submission
- Verify the application-security relationship mapping
- Add comprehensive logging for security property data flow
- Implement proper validation for security property information

### Issue 7: Proposed Exit Strategy Missing
**Problem**: Proposed exit strategy is completely missing when full application is created.

**Solution**:
- Implement or fix exit strategy serialization in application creation
- Add exit strategy fields to the application model if missing
- Create frontend form components for exit strategy data entry
- Ensure exit strategy data is included in application detail view
- Add validation for exit strategy completeness

### Implementation Priority

**Phase 1 (High Priority)**:
1. Fix broker ID auto-assignment issue
2. Resolve employment and address information missing
3. Fix proposed security details missing data

**Phase 2 (Medium Priority)**:
4. Resolve company asset/liability limitation to first borrower
5. Fix guarantor details missing fields
6. Implement guarantor asset/liability functionality

**Phase 3 (Lower Priority)**:
7. Implement proposed exit strategy functionality

### Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**: Create comprehensive unit tests for each serializer and model
2. **Integration Tests**: Test the complete application creation flow end-to-end
3. **Frontend Tests**: Verify all form fields are properly captured and submitted
4. **Database Tests**: Ensure all data is properly persisted and retrievable
5. **User Acceptance Testing**: Validate with actual application creation scenarios

### Monitoring and Validation

- Add comprehensive logging throughout the application creation process
- Implement data integrity checks to ensure no information is lost
- Create validation reports for each stage of application creation
- Add error tracking and alerting for failed application creations
- Implement data comparison checks between submitted and stored data
