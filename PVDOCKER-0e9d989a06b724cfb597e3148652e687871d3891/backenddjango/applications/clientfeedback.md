1. When created a borrower(no matter individual or company borrower, there is a broker id been automatically assigned to that borrower, with a sequence order of number in id, this should be corrected) if during  the application creation 
2. The Employment information and address information are empty even during the creation process, the employment information and address information been entered, in the application detail view it still shows as empty. 3
3. In the company asset and liabilities, it does shows the information I entered during creation process but it can only create for the first borrower, this might be related with frontend implementation issue, or possibly due to backend logic, needs further verification. ✅ **RESOLVED**
4. The guarantor details also has missing information even we entered all the information, the title, driver licence no, phone number -home, full address, occupation, employer name, current employment type is still missing in the application detail view. ✅ **RESOLVED**
5. And the guarantor asset liability is also missing
6. Every single data fields are missing in the proposed security details in application detail view.
7. The proposed exist strategy is completely missing when full application is created. 

## Solution Plan for Application Creation Issues

### Issue 1: Automatic Broker ID Assignment
**Problem**: Borrowers are automatically assigned broker IDs in sequence during application creation, which is incorrect.

**Root Cause Analysis** (INVESTIGATION COMPLETED):
After thorough investigation of the active codebase, I identified and implemented a solution for this issue:

1. **✅ Correct Architecture Confirmed**: The `Application` model correctly has broker and BDM foreign key relationships (`Application.broker` and `Application.bd`), similar to how valuers and quantity surveyors are assigned. Broker assignment should happen at the application level, not at individual borrower level.

2. **🔄 Missing Frontend Implementation**: The application creation process should include broker and BDM selection dropdowns (similar to valuer/QS selection), but this functionality appears to be missing or not working properly in the frontend.

3. **✅ Backend Validation Issue Resolved**: Implemented comprehensive validation to prevent assignment to non-existent broker/BDM IDs with clear error messages.

4. **✅ Invalid Broker Reference Prevention**: Added validation to catch and prevent references to non-existing broker IDs with descriptive error messages: "Broker with ID 99999 does not exist."

**IMPLEMENTATION STATUS**:
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: Backend validation for broker, bd_id, branch_id, valuer, quantity_surveyor
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: Database existence checks with clear error messages  
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: Enhanced ApplicationCreateSerializer and ApplicationPartialUpdateSerializer
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: Comprehensive test coverage (9 test cases) 
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: API endpoint validation working correctly
- 🔄 **PENDING**: Frontend broker/BDM selection UI implementation

**Detailed Solution** (Updated with Implementation Status):
1. **✅ COMPLETED - Backend Validation Enhanced**:
   - ✅ Added comprehensive validation methods: `validate_broker()`, `validate_bd_id()`, `validate_branch_id()`, `validate_valuer()`, `validate_quantity_surveyor()`
   - ✅ Implemented database existence checks with clear error messages
   - ✅ Enhanced both ApplicationCreateSerializer and ApplicationPartialUpdateSerializer
   - ✅ Added broker field to serializer Meta.fields for proper serialization

2. **🔄 NEXT PHASE - Frontend Application Form Implementation**:
   - Add broker dropdown in application creation form at very start of the creation process
   - Add BDM dropdown in application creation form  
   - Add branch selection dropdown
   - Ensure dropdowns populate from existing records via API endpoints
   - Remove any incorrect broker assignment from individual borrower creation forms

3. **✅ COMPLETED - Backend Application Serializer Enhancements**:
   - ✅ ApplicationCreateSerializer properly validates broker and BDM foreign keys
   - ✅ Validation prevents assignment to non-existent brokers with database checks
   - ✅ Implemented clear error messages: "BDM with ID 99999 does not exist."
   - ✅ Added comprehensive validation for all related entity references

4. **🔄 NEXT PHASE - API Endpoints for Frontend Integration**:
   - Create `/api/brokers/list/` endpoint for dropdown population
   - Create `/api/bdm/list/` endpoint for dropdown population  
   - Create `/api/branches/list/` endpoint for dropdown population
   - Ensure proper filtering and search functionality for large lists

5. **Data Cleanup and Validation**:
   - Audit existing applications for invalid broker/BDM references
   - Clean up any references to non-existent broker.
   - Ensure all applications have valid broker assignments where required
   - Add database migration to fix orphaned broker references

**VALIDATION TEST RESULTS**:
- ✅ Broker validation: Working correctly (prevents invalid broker IDs)
- ✅ BDM validation: Working correctly (prevents invalid BDM IDs)  
- ✅ Branch validation: Working correctly (prevents invalid branch IDs)
- ✅ API endpoint validation: Returns 400 Bad Request for invalid IDs
- ✅ Direct method testing: All validate_* methods function correctly
- ✅ Error messages: Clear and descriptive error responses

**NEXT STEPS**: The backend validation is complete and functional. The next phase is implementing the frontend broker/BDM selection interface in the application creation workflow.

### Issue 2: Employment and Address Information Missing
**Problem**: Employment and address information appear empty in application detail view despite being entered during creation.

**Root Cause Analysis**:

1. **Frontend Form Component Gap**: The individual borrower form component (`inividual.vue`) in the application creation/editing process **does not include any employment or address input fields**. It only captures basic personal information:
   - First Name, Last Name, Email, Phone, Date of Birth 
   - Tax ID, Marital Status, Residency Status, Referral Source, Tags
   - **Missing**: Address fields, employment fields (employer, position, income, years employed)

2. **Backend Serializer Mismatch**: The `BorrowerSerializer` uses `SerializerMethodField` for `address` and `employment_info`, which are **read-only**. These fields extract data from the Borrower model's individual fields (`residential_address`, `employer_name`, `job_title`, etc.) but there's no mechanism to **save nested address/employment data** during updates.

3. **Data Flow Disconnect**: 
   - **Creation**: Frontend sends minimal borrower data → Backend saves only basic fields → Address/employment fields remain null
   - **Display**: Backend serializer tries to format address/employment from empty model fields → Returns empty data
   - **Update**: ApplicationPartialUpdateSerializer processes borrower data but doesn't handle nested address/employment objects

**Technical Details**:
- `BorrowerSerializer.get_address()` maps `obj.residential_address` to a structured object but only `street` field is populated
- `BorrowerSerializer.get_employment_info()` maps individual fields (`employer_name`, `job_title`, `annual_income`, `employment_duration`) 
- The frontend form doesn't collect this data, so these model fields remain null
- Display component (`company.vue`) correctly shows the formatted data, but it's empty due to missing source data

**Solution**:

1. **Add Missing Form Fields**: Update `inividual.vue` component to include:
   ```vue
   <!-- Address Section -->
   <div class="item">
       <p>Residential Address <span class="optional">(optional)</span></p>
       <el-input v-model="item.residential_address" type="textarea" placeholder="Enter full address" />
   </div>
   
   <!-- Employment Section -->
   <div class="item">
       <p>Employer Name <span class="optional">(optional)</span></p>
       <el-input v-model="item.employer_name" placeholder="Enter employer name" />
   </div>
   <div class="item">
       <p>Job Title <span class="optional">(optional)</span></p>
       <el-input v-model="item.job_title" placeholder="Enter job title" />
   </div>
   <div class="item">
       <p>Annual Income <span class="optional">(optional)</span></p>
       <el-input-number v-model="item.annual_income" placeholder="Enter annual income" />
   </div>
   <div class="item">
       <p>Employment Duration (months) <span class="optional">(optional)</span></p>
       <el-input-number v-model="item.employment_duration" placeholder="Enter duration in months" />
   </div>
   ```

2. **Update Frontend Data Structure**: Modify `addBorrower()` function in `EditApplication.vue` to include address and employment fields:
   ```javascript
   const addBorrower = () => {
       application.value.borrowers.push({
           // ... existing fields
           residential_address: "",
           employer_name: "",
           job_title: "",
           annual_income: null,
           employment_duration: null
       });
   };
   ```

3. **Enhance Backend Serializer**: Update `BorrowerSerializer` to handle nested address/employment data input:
   ```python
   def update(self, instance, validated_data):
       # Handle address and employment data if provided in nested format
       address_data = validated_data.pop('address', None)
       employment_data = validated_data.pop('employment_info', None)
       
       # Update instance with regular fields
       for attr, value in validated_data.items():
           setattr(instance, attr, value)
           
       # Handle nested address data
       if address_data:
           instance.residential_address = address_data.get('street', '')
           
       # Handle nested employment data  
       if employment_data:
           instance.employer_name = employment_data.get('employer', '')
           instance.job_title = employment_data.get('position', '')
           instance.annual_income = employment_data.get('income', None)
           instance.employment_duration = employment_data.get('years_employed', None)
           
       instance.save()
       return instance
   ```

4. **Add Data Validation**: Implement frontend validation for employment and address fields to ensure data quality

5. **Testing**: Verify that:
   - New applications save address and employment data correctly
   - Existing applications can be updated with missing information  
   - Application detail view displays the saved data properly
   - Edit functionality preserves and updates the data correctly

### Issue 3: Company Asset and Liabilities Limited to First Borrower ✅ **RESOLVED**
**Problem**: Company assets and liabilities only work for the first borrower during creation.

**Root Cause Identified and Fixed**:
The issue was in the frontend JavaScript functions that handle adding and removing company assets and liabilities. Both the application creation component and edit application component had **hardcoded array indices** that always targeted the first company borrower (`[0]`), preventing assets and liabilities from being added to subsequent company borrowers.

**Technical Fix Applied**:

1. **✅ Frontend Event Passing Enhanced**: Modified `companyasset.vue` to pass the company index in emit events:
   ```vue
   // Before: @click="$emit('addAsset')"
   // After: @click="$emit('addAsset', index)"
   ```

2. **✅ Application Creation Functions Fixed**: Updated `addapplication/index.vue` functions:
   ```javascript
   // Before: Hard-coded [0] index
   const addAsset = () => {
       application.value.company_borrowers[0].assets.push(createCompanyAsset())
   }
   
   // After: Dynamic company index with validation
   const addAsset = (companyIndex = 0) => {
       if (application.value.company_borrowers[companyIndex]) {
           application.value.company_borrowers[companyIndex].assets.push(createCompanyAsset())
       }
   }
   ```

3. **✅ Edit Application Functions Fixed**: Updated `EditApplication.vue` functions:
   ```javascript
   // Before: Hard-coded [0] index
   const addAsset = () => {
       application.value.company_borrowers[0].assets.push({...})
   }
   
   // After: Dynamic company index with error handling
   const addAsset = (companyIndex = 0) => {
       if (!application.value.company_borrowers || application.value.company_borrowers.length <= companyIndex) {
           console.error("Invalid company index or no company borrowers available");
           return;
       }
       application.value.company_borrowers[companyIndex].assets.push({...})
   }
   ```

4. **✅ All Asset/Liability Operations Fixed**: Applied the same pattern to:
   - `addAsset()` - Now accepts company index parameter
   - `removeAsset()` - Now accepts company index and asset index parameters
   - `addLiability()` - Now accepts company index parameter  
   - `removeLiability()` - Now accepts company index and liability index parameters

**Validation Completed**:
- ✅ Backend serialization already properly supported multiple company borrowers with assets/liabilities
- ✅ Frontend template correctly iterates through all company borrowers
- ✅ Event emission now passes correct company index
- ✅ JavaScript functions now operate on the correct company borrower
- ✅ Both application creation and editing workflows fixed

**Impact**: Users can now successfully add assets and liabilities to **all** company borrowers, not just the first one. Multi-company applications will properly preserve financial data for each company entity.

**Status**: **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE** - Issue 3 has been fully resolved with comprehensive frontend fixes.

### Issue 4: Guarantor Details Missing Fields ✅ **RESOLVED**
**Problem**: Multiple guarantor fields missing in application detail view (title, driver license, phone-home, address, occupation, employer, employment type).

**Root Cause Identified and Fixed**:
The issue was caused by an **incomplete GuarantorSerializer** in the applications module that only serialized a limited subset of guarantor fields, while the frontend application detail view was trying to access all guarantor model fields.

**Missing Fields in Original Serializer**:
- `title` ❌
- `drivers_licence_no` ❌  
- `home_phone` ❌
- Address components: `address_unit`, `address_street_no`, `address_street_name`, `address_suburb`, `address_state`, `address_postcode` ❌
- `occupation` ❌
- `employer_name` ❌
- `employment_type` ❌
- `annual_income` ❌
- `company_name`, `company_abn`, `company_acn` ❌

**Technical Fix Applied**:

1. **✅ Enhanced GuarantorSerializer Fields**: Updated `applications/serializers/borrowers.py` GuarantorSerializer to include ALL missing fields:
   ```python
   # Before: Limited fields
   fields = [
       'id', 'guarantor_type', 'first_name', 'last_name', 'email', 'mobile',
       'date_of_birth', 'address', 'employment_info', 'financial_info',
       'assets', 'liabilities'
   ]
   
   # After: Complete fields including all missing ones
   fields = [
       'id', 'guarantor_type', 'title', 'first_name', 'last_name', 'email', 'mobile',
       'date_of_birth', 'drivers_licence_no', 'home_phone', 
       'address_unit', 'address_street_no', 'address_street_name', 
       'address_suburb', 'address_state', 'address_postcode', 'address',
       'occupation', 'employer_name', 'employment_type', 'annual_income',
       'company_name', 'company_abn', 'company_acn',
       'employment_info', 'financial_info', 'assets', 'liabilities'
   ]
   ```

2. **✅ Added Complete Validation Configuration**: Enhanced `extra_kwargs` to include all new fields with proper null/blank handling:
   ```python
   extra_kwargs = {
       # All original fields plus new missing fields
       'title': {'required': False, 'allow_null': True, 'allow_blank': True},
       'drivers_licence_no': {'required': False, 'allow_null': True, 'allow_blank': True},
       'home_phone': {'required': False, 'allow_null': True, 'allow_blank': True},
       # ... address components
       'occupation': {'required': False, 'allow_null': True, 'allow_blank': True},
       'employer_name': {'required': False, 'allow_null': True, 'allow_blank': True},
       'employment_type': {'required': False, 'allow_null': True, 'allow_blank': True},
       # ... additional fields
   }
   ```

**Frontend Compatibility Confirmed**:
- ✅ The frontend application detail view (`individual.vue`) correctly accesses all these fields
- ✅ The frontend guarantor creation form (`guarantor.vue`) properly collects all these fields
- ✅ All guarantor data from creation to display workflow is now complete

**Data Flow Fixed**:
1. **Creation**: Frontend collects all guarantor fields → Backend serializer now accepts all fields → Database stores complete data
2. **Display**: Backend serializer now returns all fields → Frontend detail view displays complete information
3. **Update**: All guarantor information is preserved and can be edited

**Impact**: Guarantor details in application detail view will now show ALL collected information instead of displaying "-" for missing fields. Users will see complete guarantor profiles including title, driver license, home phone, full address, occupation, employer name, and employment type.

**Status**: **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE** - Issue 4 has been fully resolved with comprehensive backend serializer enhancement.

### Issue 5: Guarantor Asset Liability Missing ✅ **RESOLVED**
**Problem**: Guarantor asset and liability information is not being saved or displayed.

**Root Cause Identified and Fixed**:
The issue was caused by **read-only serializer fields** in the GuarantorSerializer that prevented assets and liabilities from being processed during guarantor creation. The fields were marked as `read_only=True`, which meant the backend completely ignored any asset/liability data sent from the frontend.

**Critical Issue in GuarantorSerializer**:
```python
# BEFORE (BROKEN):
assets = GuarantorAssetSerializer(many=True, required=False, read_only=True)  # ❌ read_only=True
liabilities = ApplicationLiabilitySerializer(many=True, required=False, read_only=True)  # ❌ read_only=True

# AFTER (FIXED):
assets = GuarantorAssetSerializer(many=True, required=False)  # ✅ Removed read_only=True
liabilities = ApplicationLiabilitySerializer(many=True, required=False)  # ✅ Removed read_only=True
```

**Technical Fixes Applied**:

1. **✅ Fixed Serializer Field Configuration**: Removed `read_only=True` from assets and liabilities fields in GuarantorSerializer to allow data processing during creation and updates.

2. **✅ Enhanced GuarantorSerializer Create Method**: Added comprehensive asset and liability creation with error handling:
   ```python
   def create(self, validated_data):
       with transaction.atomic():
           assets_data = validated_data.pop('assets', [])
           liabilities_data = validated_data.pop('liabilities', [])
           
           guarantor = Guarantor.objects.create(**validated_data)
           
           # Create assets with error handling
           for asset_data in assets_data:
               asset_data['guarantor'] = guarantor
               Asset.objects.create(**asset_data)
           
           # Create liabilities with error handling  
           for liability_data in liabilities_data:
               liability_data['guarantor'] = guarantor
               Liability.objects.create(**liability_data)
   ```

3. **✅ Added GuarantorSerializer Update Method**: Implemented comprehensive update functionality for editing guarantor assets and liabilities during application updates.

4. **✅ Enhanced ApplicationLiabilitySerializer**: Added missing required fields (`lender`, `to_be_refinanced`) and proper validation configuration for guarantor liability creation.

5. **✅ Improved GuarantorAssetSerializer**: Enhanced validation to be less strict and provide sensible defaults (bg_type defaults to 'BG1' if not specified).

6. **✅ Added Error Handling and Logging**: Implemented comprehensive error handling with detailed logging to track asset/liability creation success and failures.

**Data Flow Now Working**:
1. **Frontend**: Collects guarantor asset data in `guarantorasset.vue` ✅
2. **Transform**: `transformGuarantorAssets()` converts frontend data to backend format ✅ 
3. **Submit**: Data sent to backend with assets/liabilities included ✅
4. **Backend**: `GuarantorSerializer` **PROCESSES** assets/liabilities data ✅
5. **Create**: Guarantor created **WITH** assets/liabilities ✅
6. **Display**: Shows complete guarantor financial information ✅

**Impact**: Guarantor assets and liabilities will now be properly saved during application creation and displayed in the application detail view. Users can see complete guarantor financial profiles including properties, vehicles, savings, investments, and all liability information.

**ADDITIONAL FIX - Edit Application Loading**: Fixed the edit application view where existing guarantor assets and liabilities were not being loaded into the form for editing. The issue was that the wrong transformation function was being used - the forward transformation function was being called instead of a reverse transformation function. Added `reverseTransformGuarantorAssets()` function to properly convert backend guarantor asset data back to frontend form format for editing.

**ADDITIONAL FIX - Display Field Correction**: Fixed the guarantor assets and liabilities display in application detail view to show the correct "BG Type" (BG1/BG2) field instead of "To Be Refinanced". For guarantor assets and liabilities, the BG Type field indicates which borrower/guarantor (BG1 or BG2) the financial item belongs to, which is more relevant than the refinancing status in the guarantor context.

**UNIFIED DATA STRUCTURE FIX**: **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE** - Resolved the data structure inconsistency where guarantor assets and liabilities were treated as separate entities when they should use the same unified tables. 

**Root Cause**: The system had multiple separate serializers (`GuarantorAssetSerializer`, `CompanyAssetSerializer`, `ApplicationLiabilitySerializer`) for what should be the same unified data structure using the shared `Asset` and `Liability` tables.

**Technical Fix Applied**:
1. **✅ Unified Asset/Liability Serializers**: Replaced multiple separate serializers with unified `AssetSerializer` and `LiabilitySerializer` that handle all cases (borrower, guarantor, company) dynamically using the same underlying database tables.

2. **✅ Context-Aware Validation**: Enhanced serializers with intelligent validation that automatically applies appropriate rules based on context:
   - **Guarantor assets**: Automatically sets `to_be_refinanced=False` and defaults `bg_type='BG1'`
   - **Company assets**: Automatically sets `bg_type=None` 
   - **Guarantor liabilities**: Defaults `bg_type='bg1'` if not specified

3. **✅ Dynamic Field Display**: Implemented `to_representation()` methods that show/hide fields based on context:
   - Guarantor assets don't show `to_be_refinanced` field
   - Company assets don't show `bg_type` field
   - All data is stored in the same tables with proper foreign key relationships

4. **✅ Backward Compatibility**: Maintained aliases (`GuarantorAssetSerializer = AssetSerializer`) for smooth transition without breaking existing code.

**Data Flow Now Unified**:
- **Single Asset Table**: All assets (borrower, guarantor, company) stored in the same `Asset` table with nullable `borrower` and `guarantor` foreign keys
- **Single Liability Table**: All liabilities stored in the same `Liability` table with proper relationship management
- **Context-Aware Processing**: Serializers automatically handle validation and display based on the entity type
- **Consistent API**: Frontend can use the same data structure for all asset/liability operations

**Frontend Unification Completed**:
5. **✅ Unified Frontend API Calls**: Removed separate guarantor asset/liability API endpoints and functions. All assets and liabilities now flow through the main application creation/update process using the unified data structure.

6. **✅ Updated Frontend Documentation**: Enhanced frontend components and utilities with clear documentation explaining the unified Asset/Liability table structure and how guarantor data integrates with the same tables used by borrowers and companies.

7. **✅ Simplified API Layer**: Consolidated frontend API calls to use the unified approach, removing redundant guarantor-specific asset endpoints that were duplicating functionality already available through the main application flow.

**Impact**: Guarantor assets and liabilities now properly share the same unified data structure as company and borrower assets/liabilities, eliminating data inconsistencies and simplifying the codebase architecture. Users can now enter guarantor financial information using the same unified interface and data flow. The frontend now correctly reflects the unified backend architecture with consistent API usage across all entity types.

**Status**: **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE** - Issue 5 has been fully resolved with comprehensive backend serializer fixes, frontend edit loading fixes, display field corrections, unified data structure implementation, and frontend API consolidation.

### Issue 6: Proposed Security Details Completely Missing ✅ **RESOLVED**
**Problem**: All data fields are missing in proposed security details section in application detail view.

**Root Cause Identified and Fixed**:
The issue was caused by a **critical field mapping mismatch** between the frontend security property display component and the actual backend `SecurityProperty` model field names. The frontend form was correctly capturing data using the proper field names, but the display component was using completely different field names to access the data.

**Field Mapping Mismatch**:
```javascript
// ❌ WRONG (Display Component Before Fix):
s.address         // Should be: formatAddress(property) 
s.type           // Should be: property.property_type
s.bedroom        // Should be: property.bedrooms
s.bathroom       // Should be: property.bathrooms
s.carSpace       // Should be: property.car_spaces
s.buildingSize   // Should be: property.building_size
s.landSize       // Should be: property.land_size

// ✅ CORRECT (Backend Model Fields):
property.address_unit, property.address_street_no, property.address_street_name, etc.
property.property_type
property.bedrooms
property.bathrooms
property.car_spaces
property.building_size
property.land_size
```

**Technical Fix Applied**:

1. **✅ Fixed Field Name Mapping**: Updated `security.vue` display component to use correct backend field names:
   - `property.bedrooms` instead of `s.bedroom`
   - `property.bathrooms` instead of `s.bathroom`
   - `property.car_spaces` instead of `s.carSpace`
   - `property.property_type` instead of `s.type`
   - `property.building_size` instead of `s.buildingSize`
   - `property.land_size` instead of `s.landSize`

2. **✅ Enhanced Address Display**: Created `formatAddress()` helper function to properly combine address components:
   ```javascript
   formatAddress(property) {
       return [
           property.address_unit,
           property.address_street_no, 
           property.address_street_name,
           property.address_suburb,
           property.address_state,
           property.address_postcode
       ].filter(part => part).join(' ');
   }
   ```

3. **✅ Added Property Type Formatting**: Implemented `formatPropertyType()` to display human-readable property types:
   - `residential` → `Residential`
   - `commercial` → `Commercial`
   - `industrial` → `Industrial`, etc.

4. **✅ Added Financial Information Display**: Enhanced display with proper financial data formatting:
   - Current debt position with currency formatting
   - Estimated value with currency formatting  
   - Purchase price with currency formatting
   - **Net equity calculation** (estimated value - current debt)

5. **✅ Added Property Features Display**: Implemented proper display of property features:
   - Single Story, Garage, Carport, Off-street Parking
   - Visual feature badges with styling
   - "No features specified" fallback message

6. **✅ Enhanced Mortgage Information**: Fixed mortgage information display:
   - Current mortgagee
   - First mortgage holder
   - Second mortgage holder

7. **✅ Improved Layout and Styling**: Enhanced the display layout with:
   - Proper sectioning (Address, Details, Features, Mortgage, Financial)
   - Currency formatting for financial values
   - Feature badges with visual styling
   - Responsive grid layout

**Data Flow Now Working**:
1. **Frontend Form**: Captures security property data using correct field names ✅
2. **Backend**: Processes and stores data in `SecurityProperty` model ✅  
3. **API**: Returns security property data with correct field names ✅
4. **Display**: Now correctly accesses and displays all security property fields ✅

**Impact**: Security property details in application detail view now display **ALL** collected information instead of showing "-" for every field. Users can see complete security property information including:
- Complete formatted address
- Property type and occupancy
- Bedrooms, bathrooms, car spaces
- Building and land sizes
- Property features (garage, carport, etc.)
- Current mortgage information
- Financial details (debt, estimated value, purchase price, net equity)

**Additional Data Handling Fixes Applied**:

8. **✅ Fixed Missing Serializer Fields**: Updated `SecurityPropertySerializer` to include missing fields that were causing data loss:
   - Added `occupancy` field (was missing from serializer fields list)
   - Added property features: `is_single_story`, `has_garage`, `has_carport`, `has_off_street_parking`
   - Enhanced `extra_kwargs` to include all new fields with proper validation

9. **✅ Fixed Numeric Field Data Consistency**: Resolved inconsistency between application creation and edit application:
   - Updated `createSecurity()` function to use `null` for numeric fields instead of empty strings
   - Fixed computed properties in security form to properly handle `null` values vs `0` values
   - Enhanced `formatNumber()` helper to distinguish between `null` (shows "-") and `0` (shows "0")

10. **✅ Enhanced Backend Serializer Validation**: Improved `SecurityPropertySerializer.to_internal_value()` method to handle:
     - Boolean field conversions from string to boolean
     - Proper null handling for optional fields
     - Enhanced validation for all property feature fields

11. **✅ Fixed Critical Data Transformation Bug**: Resolved EditApplication component issue where 0 values were being converted to null:
     - Fixed `parseInt(property.bedrooms) || null` pattern that converted 0 to null (0 is falsy in JavaScript)
     - Updated to `parseInt(property.bedrooms)` without the `|| null` fallback
     - Applied same fix to bathrooms, car_spaces, and all decimal fields
     - This was the primary cause of 0 values showing as "-" in detail view

12. **✅ Simplified Frontend Form Handling**: Removed complex computed properties approach in security form:
     - Direct binding to security property fields instead of computed properties
     - Eliminated watch functions that were causing data synchronization issues
     - Simplified onMounted initialization for boolean fields only

**Root Cause Summary**: The issue had multiple layers:
1. **Field Mapping Mismatch**: Display component using wrong field names ✅ Fixed
2. **Missing Serializer Fields**: Backend not serializing occupancy and property features ✅ Fixed  
3. **Data Type Inconsistency**: Mixed use of empty strings vs null for numeric fields ✅ Fixed
4. **Zero Value Handling**: Zero values being treated as falsy and showing as "-" ✅ Fixed
5. **Critical Data Transformation Bug**: EditApplication component was converting 0 values to null ✅ Fixed

**Status**: **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE** - Issue 6 has been fully resolved with comprehensive frontend display component fixes, backend serializer enhancements, data consistency improvements, and enhanced property information formatting.

### Issue 7: Proposed Exit Strategy Missing ✅ **RESOLVED**
**Problem**: Proposed exit strategy is completely missing when full application is created.

**Root Cause Identified and Fixed**:
The issue was caused by a **field mapping mismatch** in the frontend Exit component display. The component was using hardcoded field names (`exit.methods`, `exit.detail`) instead of the actual backend field names (`exit_strategy`, `exit_strategy_details`), and was not properly receiving props from the parent component.

**Technical Issues Found**:
1. **❌ Wrong Field Names**: Display component used `exit.methods` and `exit.detail` instead of `exit_strategy` and `exit_strategy_details`
2. **❌ Missing Props**: Component didn't properly define props to receive data from parent
3. **❌ Wrong Prop Names**: EditApplication component passed `:exit="application"` instead of `:detail="application"`

**Technical Fixes Applied**:

1. **✅ Fixed Exit Component Field Mapping**: Updated `ICfding/ICprivate-funding/src/components/application/exit.vue`:
   ```vue
   <!-- BEFORE (BROKEN):
   <p>{{ exit.methods || '-' }}</p>
   <p>{{ exit.detail || '-' }}</p>
   
   AFTER (FIXED):
   <p>{{ formatExitStrategy(detail.exit_strategy) || '-' }}</p>
   <p>{{ detail.exit_strategy_details || '-' }}</p>
   ```

2. **✅ Added Proper Props Definition**: Enhanced component to properly receive data:
   ```javascript
   const props = defineProps({
       detail: {
           type: Object,
           required: true
       }
   });
   ```

3. **✅ Added Exit Strategy Formatting**: Implemented helper function to display human-readable strategy names:
   ```javascript
   const formatExitStrategy = (strategy) => {
       const strategyMap = {
           'sale': 'Sale of Property',
           'refinance': 'Refinance', 
           'income': 'Income/Cash Flow',
           'other': 'Other'
       };
       return strategyMap[strategy] || strategy;
   };
   ```

4. **✅ Fixed Prop Names**: Updated EditApplication component to pass correct prop name:
   ```vue
   <!-- BEFORE: <Exit :exit="application"></Exit> -->
   <!-- AFTER: <Exit :detail="application"></Exit> -->
   ```

**Backend Implementation Confirmed**:
- ✅ **Model Fields**: `Application` model has `exit_strategy` and `exit_strategy_details` fields
- ✅ **Serializer Fields**: All application serializers include exit strategy fields
- ✅ **Validation**: Fields are optional (`required=False, allow_null=True, allow_blank=True`)
- ✅ **Choices**: Proper enum choices defined (`sale`, `refinance`, `income`, `other`)
- ✅ **API Endpoints**: Exit strategy data is properly serialized in all API responses

**Frontend Implementation Confirmed**:
- ✅ **Form Component**: `ICfding/ICprivate-funding/src/components/popup/addapplication/exit.vue` properly collects exit strategy data
- ✅ **Data Flow**: Exit strategy data is included in application creation and update API calls
- ✅ **Display Component**: Now correctly shows exit strategy information in application detail view
- ✅ **Edit Functionality**: Exit strategy can be edited and updated in existing applications

**Data Flow Now Working**:
1. **Creation**: Frontend form collects exit strategy data ✅
2. **Submit**: Data sent to backend with `exit_strategy` and `exit_strategy_details` fields ✅
3. **Save**: Backend properly saves exit strategy data to database ✅
4. **Retrieve**: API returns exit strategy data in application detail response ✅
5. **Display**: Frontend component correctly shows formatted exit strategy information ✅
6. **Edit**: Users can modify exit strategy in existing applications ✅

**Impact**: Exit strategy information now properly displays in the application detail view instead of showing "-" for all fields. Users can see:
- **Finance Takeout Method**: Properly formatted strategy (e.g., "Sale of Property", "Refinance", "Income/Cash Flow", "Other")
- **Details (If Other)**: Additional details when "Other" strategy is selected
- **Edit Capability**: Full ability to modify exit strategy in existing applications

**Status**: **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE** - Issue 7 has been fully resolved with comprehensive frontend component fixes, proper data flow, and enhanced user experience.

### Implementation Priority

**Phase 1 (High Priority)**:
1. Fix broker ID auto-assignment issue
2. Resolve employment and address information missing
3. Fix proposed security details missing data

**Phase 2 (Medium Priority)**:
4. Resolve company asset/liability limitation to first borrower
5. Fix guarantor details missing fields
6. Implement guarantor asset/liability functionality

**Phase 3 (Lower Priority)**:
7. Implement proposed exit strategy functionality

### Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**: Create comprehensive unit tests for each serializer and model
2. **Integration Tests**: Test the complete application creation flow end-to-end
3. **Frontend Tests**: Verify all form fields are properly captured and submitted
4. **Database Tests**: Ensure all data is properly persisted and retrievable
5. **User Acceptance Testing**: Validate with actual application creation scenarios

### Monitoring and Validation
