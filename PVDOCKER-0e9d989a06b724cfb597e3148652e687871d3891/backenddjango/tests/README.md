# Test Implementation Plan

This document outlines the implementation of the test gap analysis plan, focusing on improving test coverage and reliability.

## Phase 1: Fix Existing Tests & Critical Infrastructure

### Completed Tasks

1. ✅ Installed pytest and required dependencies
   ```bash
   docker exec -it lianv3-501a294797023b7f3fa802ddb963f1a4b1577785-backend-1 pip install pytest pytest-django
   ```

2. ✅ Fixed model test failures
   - Updated Borrower model tests to match actual model fields:
     - Changed `address` to `residential_address`
     - Changed `employment_status` to `employment_type`
     - Added test for company borrower string representation
   - Fixed string representation tests:
     - Updated User model test to use email instead of username
     - Updated Broker model test to include company name
     - Updated Notification model test to include notification type

3. ✅ Created proper test fixtures and utilities
   - Set up pytest configuration in `pytest.ini`
   - Created common test fixtures in `conftest.py` for:
     - Users (admin, staff, broker, client)
     - Branch
     - BDM
     - Broker
     - Borrowers (individual and company)
     - Notification
   - Created mock utilities in `tests/utils.py` for:
     - Mock requests
     - Celery tasks
     - AWS S3 operations
     - Email services

4. ✅ Fixed missing model functionality
   - Added `mark_as_read` method to Notification model
   - Added `read_at` field to Notification model
   - Created and applied migration for the new field

### Next Steps

1. Run all unit tests to identify any remaining failures
   ```bash
   docker exec -it lianv3-501a294797023b7f3fa802ddb963f1a4b1577785-backend-1 python -m pytest tests/unit/
   ```

2. Generate coverage report for unit tests
   ```bash
   docker exec -it lianv3-501a294797023b7f3fa802ddb963f1a4b1577785-backend-1 python -m pytest tests/unit/ --cov=.
   ```

3. Begin Phase 2: Critical Gaps - Services & Tasks
   - Focus on increasing service coverage from <20% to >60%
   - Add initial task testing infrastructure

## Test Coverage Summary

| Serializers | 54-100% | Good to Excellent |
| Views | 38-93% | Poor to Excellent |
| Services | 0-43% | Poor |
| Filters | 0-97% | Poor to Excellent |
| Tasks | 0% | Missing |
| WebSocket Consumers | 0% | Missing |
