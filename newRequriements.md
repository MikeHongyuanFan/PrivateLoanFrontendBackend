1. When entering the fields, I don't want anything that is a required field, because we need to enter in the details as soon as we receive the scenario, but we don't necessarily have all the information at that point.
2. Could we please add a "Next" button between the "Cancel" and "Save" button when we're adding a new application?
3. Get rid of the auto-selection on the "General Solvency Enquiries" tab
4. In Loan Details > Application Type, change the drop down list to Acquisition, Refinance, Equity Release, Refinance & Equity Release, 2nd Mortgage, Caveat, Other (add textbox if other is selected)
5. In Loan Details we also need to add in Capitalised Interest Term (Months)
6. I need a valuer and QS as related people so we're not re-entering their details every time
7. It doesn't allow me to change save the application despite filling everything in as required
8. There's nowhere in the application that allows me to link it to the broker, BDM, Branch etc. That should ideally be the first thing we fill out
9. In the "Branch" section, get rid of address, phone number and email address. We only need the branch name as they're all internal entities anyway. Could we also change Branch to Branch/Subsidiary?
10. In the Broker section could we add a drop down menu to assign a BDM to them?
10. In the Broker section, make it locked so that only the Super User and Accounts can change the Commission Account once it's been entered for the first time
11. In the User > Roles section, could we please make them the following: Accouts, Admin, Business Development Manager, Business Development Associate, Credit Manager, Super User (Super Users have full access to all information and can edit and change everything, we will break down what each role can see at a later stage given we are still working out bugs etc at the moment aside from what I've previously mentioned)
12. Is there a way for us to autofill/mail merge information we've filled in the application into preset templates?
13. As I wasn't able to create an application, I can't test out the notifications/alerts systems.
14. I can't seem to see a section for alerts either to sort by user. Can we please get this made when we enter the alerts systems?
15. For the Documents Upload section, could we make it so we can search the app ID & Borrower ID by name/address?
16. I need a section again in the beginning of the app section to show what stage the application is at and we can also filter apps using this. The stages are as follows: Received, Sent to Lender/Investor, Funding Table Issued, Indicative Letter Issued, Indicative Letter Signed, Commitmnet Fee Received, Application Submitted, Valuation Ordered, Valuation Received, More Information Required, Formal Approval, Loan Documents Instructed, Loan Documents Issued, Loan Documents Signed, Settlement Conditions, Settled, Closed, Discharged.
17. All apps with the status of "Closed" are automatically archived and removed from the dashboard. However, we still need to be able to search for it.
18. All apps with the status of "Settled" are allocated towards "Active Loans" and will need to fill in an additional section with the following fields: Settlement Date, Capitalised Interest (Months), Interest Payments Required (Yes/No; if Yes, frequency & payment due date(s)), Loan Expiry Date. We also need an auto-reminder/alert set up so that the Admin gets an alert 2 weeks prior to the each interest payment is due and 1 month before Loan Expiry.
